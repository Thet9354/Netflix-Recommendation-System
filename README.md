To create this project, you’ll need to import a range of modules, including tkinter, re, nltk, pandas, and numpy (see pip install instructions for new modules). You’ll also need to download a Kaggle dataset containing Netflix movies and TV shows. 

We’ll use tkinter to create our GUI, which will use labels, buttons, and entry fields. The user will then be able to enter a TV show or movie they enjoyed on Netflix to return recommendations based on their taste. 

The recommendation engine uses cast, director, ratings, country, and genres as machine learning (ML) ‘features’. The code then uses the ‘cosine similarity’ approach to find similar results based on user input. This extensively uses pandas and numpy to clean the data and prepare it for processing.
